MEDiverse is a website that allows patients to look up LGBTQ+-friendly healthcare providers (and specifics, such as whether they are transgender-friendly, etc) at the click of a button.

What makes it unique, however, is that it runs entirely on user-provided reviews; doctors on the database are rated according to this user data. It is easy for a clinic to proclaim that they are inclusive and welcoming, but patients with less than stellar experiences beg to differ; building a database of doctors and clinics that is based on what patients have to say about their personal experiences with healthcare providers thus ensures a more accurate picture of which medical establishments are truly inclusive and welcoming.

MEDiverse also lets the patient search up the name of a doctor they are looking into in order to see what other patients are saying about them, allowing the patient to decide prior to booking an appointment whether a doctor is suitable for their needs or not - thus saving them the effort of a potential bad experience.
