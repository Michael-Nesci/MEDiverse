                <p>MEDiverse is a website that allows patients to look up LGBTQ+-friendly healthcare providers (and specifics, such as whether they are transgender-friendly, etc) at the click of a button. What makes it unique, however, is that it runs entirely on user-provided reviews; doctors on the database are rated according to this user data.<br><br><br>
                It is easy for a clinic to proclaim that they are inclusive and welcoming, but patients with less than stellar experiences beg to differ; building a database of doctors and clinics that is based on what patients have to say about their personal experiences with healthcare providers thus ensures a more accurate picture of which medical establishments are truly inclusive and welcoming.<br><br></p>
